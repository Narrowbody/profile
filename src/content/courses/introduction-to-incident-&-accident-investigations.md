#### Description:

Incidents and accidents require the coming together of a number of enabling factors, each one
necessary, but in itself not sufficient to breach system defenses. Major equipment failures, or
operational personnel errors, are seldom the sole cause of breaches in safety defenses. Often
these breakdowns are the consequence of human failures in decision-making. The breakdowns
may involve active failures at the operational level, or they may involve latent conditions
conducive to facilitating a breach of the system’s inherent safety defense. Most accidents
include both active and latent failures.

This course provides attendees with an overview of the procedures and methods used and the
skills required to investigate aviation related incidents and accidents. Facilitated class exercises
involving actual industry events are used to demonstrate and practice particular aspects of the
investigative process. Participants will learn; how to plan and conduct investigations, the
difference between accidents and incidents, the importance of conducting thorough
investigation’s, methodology used in root cause analysis, report writing and how to effectively
incorporate the resulting safety actions into the organization.
